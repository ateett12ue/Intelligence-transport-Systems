### Intelligence-Transport-Systems

## Abstract

This study uses regression analysis to evaluate long-run traffic management system performance. Intelligent Transport system is an established route to resolve or at least minimize traffic problems.

The issue of traffic management is a big challenge in front of todayâ€™s evolving world. There are various schemes and methods introduced by government in order to handle the same.

In this project we have tried to handle this problem using the principles of optimization in order to minimize the traffic by synchronizing public and private transportation system.

## Introduction

According to the census community of 2011, it was found that 17.9% of growing Indian population is fully depended on public transportation system whereas 35.7% of the population has no option rather than private transportation because of the 2 main issues first one is time and the second one is pollution. With rapid urbanization and growing transportation demand, India is facing great issues of pollution which is in turn caused by the inadequate public transport and rapid motorization. Traffic is the second problem can be said to be caused by mixing of slow and fast vehicles without segregation. Other problem being to be transportation energy demand and carbon emissions rising.

The cause of the problem is poor quality and insufficient capacity of roads, population growing from 4.6 times whereas vehicle number has increased 158 times and having insufficient road space available to public transport.

With this idea in mind, the government is motivating the general authorities for advanced transportation facilities and management. In this project we will be implementing optimization techniques and algorithms such that we can define the public and private transportation for all 2 lakhs users, minimum number of transportation available at time to general public, using transportation such that the pollution realize can be minimized, scheduling public transportation to increase its frequency and decreasing time of traveling and no of public transportation that should be used between 5 am to 11 pm such that public can prefer public transportation rather than private transportation.

# Model 1

In Jaipur city there are two basic type of on road transportation classified as public and private. Government has provided buses for public transport which can accommodate maximum of 40 passengers at a time on the other hand 4 person can travel in a private vehicle. On a regular day 2 lakhs people need to travel within the city using private as well as public vehicles. Government implemented a policy such that for every 50 private vehicles there is one public vehicle running on the road in order to synchronize the ratio between public and private vehicles. Due to ever increasing vehicles in the city, pollution index of the city is on the rise. On a regular day a bus emits an average of 350 ppm of carbon particles and a private vehicle emits 50 ppm of carbon particles. Due to such increase in pollution for every 100 bus in the city a pollution reducing machine is installed which reduces the quantity of carbon by 10000 ppm in a day. Find the optimum number of private and public vehicles such that pollution produced in a day is minimized. Number of public and private vehicles should not exceed by 1000 and 45000 respectively.

# Model 2

Jaipur Government wants to use the minimum number of buses in order to reduce pollution and cost for implementing public transport. For that purpose government planned a new strategy according to which a particular bus has to complete its shift of 6 hours per day. A bus can travel from one place to another in a time period of 3 hours and has to return back to its origin by the next 3 hours.

Buses start running from 5:00 in the morning and end their day by 11:00 pm. This whole schedule is divided into 6 shifts of 3 hours each. In a day minimum of 1,65,000 people travel from bus and each bus can accommodate 40 people.
The buses must satisfy the requirements as shown in the following table.

Time Slot Minimum no. of passengers
05:00-08:00 5000
08:00-11:00 60000
11:00-14:00 10000
14:00-17:00 30000
17:00-20:00 20000
20:00-23:00 40000
